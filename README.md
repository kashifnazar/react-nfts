# React NFTs

A React + TypeScript application (initiated using Vite) that connects to a serverless backend, Moralis, to list NFTs.

This is to demonstrate my skills with React Hooks, Context API, creating highly reusable components (taking separation of concern into account), a well organized directory and creating web design using Tailwind CSS.

## Tech stack

## Running the application

## The application should be accessible on the following URL
http://localhost:5173/

```
